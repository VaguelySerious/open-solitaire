Example file for what needs to be defined to create a solitaire card game using the framework. I.e. content of an example "klondike.js"

> Icon
> Menu text

> Undo count, hints
> Scoring rules
> Stack count, card amount, distribution, color-spectrum
> Cycle icon and special stack-outline locations
	(Either pass the css file or parameters to construct the
	css file via javascript)

> Which stacks/cards are single-click interactions
> Which stacks/card are interactible together with a second card,
	(click/drag depends on toggle box)
> For every stack, a rule that needs to apply to a card being
	moved in, or a card being moved out of it.

> Win conditions
> Loss conditions
> Rules to pass to the unsolvable/hint algorithm
	(but this one should take the same rules that are specified
	for user movement, so maybe this doesn't need to be defined)
